This program trashes workout notes in Google Keep whose contents have already been written to the target file. 

*How it works*
 - This program checks which notes in Keep have already been written to the local xlsx file
 - It presents the user a portion of the note as retrieved from Google Keep, for comparison with that note's representation in the target xlsx file. (So that the user may confirm that the note has indeed been written correctly). 
 - It requests a date to delete up to
 - It requests permission to delete
 - It trashes the presented notes in Google Keep up to that user-specified date, assuming permission was granted.
