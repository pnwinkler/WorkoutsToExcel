This program trashes workout notes in whose contents have already been written to the target file. 

**How it works** (subject to change)
 - This program checks which source notes have already been written to the target file
 - It presents to the user for comparison (so that the user may confirm that the note has indeed been written correctly):
   - a portion of the source note 
   - that note's representation in the target file
 - It requests a date to delete up to
 - It requests permission to delete
 - It trashes or deletes the presented notes up to that specified date, if permission was granted.
