This program trashes workout notes in whose contents have already been written to the target file. 

**How it works** (subject to change)
 1) This program checks which source notes have already been written to the target file
 2) It presents to the user for comparison (so that the user may confirm that the note has indeed been written correctly):
    - a portion of the source note 
    - that note's representation in the target file
 3) It requests a date to delete up to
 4) It requests permission to delete
 5) It trashes or deletes the presented notes up to that specified date, if permission was granted.
