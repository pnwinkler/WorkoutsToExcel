Bench press 75kg: 8,8,7,6,8
(75kg: 8,8,8,7,7)
/Should I be hammering through or doing maximum controlled? IMO aim for fast as possible while staying tight (meaning there should be no chest bounce i.a.)
/Form and new equipment will take some getting used to here. That's also why it's 75 not 72.5
/RPE 9.5. IMO don't push for more yet. Felt weaker today perhaps because of yesterday's tricep work. I don't know if I should be doing triceps on leg day. Feel unstable today.
/If really tough, use full leg drive
